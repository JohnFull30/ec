WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's first quarter, 2025 Q&A webcast.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.280
 My name is Travis Oxrod, head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.600
 Debatoneja, and a number of other executives.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.600
 Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. central time in the Update Deck, the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.720
 published at the same link as this webcast.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.640
 During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.000
 These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.920
 Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.920
 including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.800
 During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.000
 question and one follow-up.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.400
 Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:01:04.080
 Before we jump into Q&A, Elon will be providing an update.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:14.480
 I think the work that we're doing there is actually very important for trying to sprain

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:21.320
 in the insane deficit that is meeting our country, the United States, to destruction.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.000
 The DOGE team has made a lot of progress in addressing waste and fraud.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.040
 The natural blowback from that is those who were receiving the wasteful dollars and the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:39.840
 fortune of dollars will try to attack me and those team and anything associated with me.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.280
 I'm really left with two choices.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.080
 Should we just let the waste and fraud continue and it was continuing at it to grow at a really

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.120
 unsustainable pace that was bankrupting the country or to fight the waste and fraud and

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.920
 try to get the country back on the right track.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.320
 Tonight, I believe the right thing to do is to specify the waste and fraud and get the

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.000
 country back on the right track and working together with President Trump and his administration.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.240
 Because if the shift from America goes down, we all go down with it, including Tesla and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
 everyone else.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.440
 So, I think this is critical work.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.800
 The protests that you'll see out there, they're very organized, they're paid for.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.680
 They're obviously not going to admit that the reason that they're protesting is because

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.760
 they're receiving fraudulent money or that they're the recipients of wasteful large

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760
 s.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.000
 But they're going to think I can vote for some other reason.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.520
 But that is the real reason for the protests.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.880
 The actual reason is that those receiving the waste and fraud wish to continue receiving

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.880
 it.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.520
 That is the real thing that's going on here, obviously.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:17.520
 So, now that said, I do think there's, you know, the large slug of work necessary to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:25.200
 get the phone team in place and working in the government to get the financial housing

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.120
 order is mostly done.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:46.840
 And I think starting probably in next month, May, my time allocation to do is will drop

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
 significantly.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.440
 I'll have to continue doing it for, I think, the remainder of the president's term just

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.840
 to make sure that the waste and fraud that we stop does not come roaring back, which

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.520
 we'll do if it has the chance.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:16.040
 So I think I'll continue to spend, you know, a day or two per week on government matters

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.800
 for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:31.700
 But starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla, and now that

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.720
 the major work of establishing the Department of Government efficiency is done.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:48.720
 So at Tesla, we've gone through many, many crisis over the years and actually been through

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.720
 many, many near-death experiences, like we probably were on the ragged edge of death,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.360
 at least on maybe a dozen times, it's been so many times.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.040
 This is not one of those times, we're not on the ragged edge of death, not even close.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:18.000
 So there are some challenges, and I expect that this year will be, there will probably

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.360
 be some unexpected bumps this year, but I remain extremely optimistic about the future

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.360
 of the company.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:39.920
 The future of the company is fundamentally based on large-scale, autonomous cars and

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.800
 large-scale and large-volume, vast numbers of autonomous human-right robots.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:59.180
 So the value of the company that makes truly useful autonomous human-right robots and autonomous

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:10.360
 useful vehicles at low-cost, which is what Tesla is going to do, is staggering.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.920
 I continue to believe that Tesla with excellent execution will be the most valuable company

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.540
 in the world by far, but that's an important if.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:31.680
 We must execute well, but if we do execute well, I think Tesla will be the most valuable

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.760
 company in the world by far, it may be as valuable as the next five companies combined.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:46.160
 So there will be a few bumps along the road before that happens.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:57.960
 I said, I think, in the last earnings call that we'll start to see the prosperity of

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.200
 autonomy take effect in a material way around the middle of next year.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:12.040
 We expect to be selling fully autonomous rights in June and Austin as we've been saying for

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.920
 now several months.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.520
 So that's continued, but the real question from financial standpoint is when does it

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.840
 really become material and affect the bottom line of the company and then start to be a

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:33.740
 fundamental part of the, when does it move the financial needle in a significant way?

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:40.080
 That's probably around the middle of next year, second half of next year.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.800
 And then once it does start to move the national needle in a significant way, it will really

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.800
 go exponential from there.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:08:01.040
 So that's, I encourage people to look beyond like the, you know, some bumps and potholes

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:14.480
 of the road immediately ahead of us, but lift your gaze to the bright shining, you know,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:21.760
 the down on the hill, I don't know, some Reagan Esk imagery.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.720
 And that's where we're headed.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:38.440
 And not just in future likes it in the next year or two, so let's see.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.040
 With respect to supply chain risk, some of the, some of the Tesla has been working on

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.360
 for several years is to localize supply chains.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:56.800
 This actually makes sense from a cost standpoint and from a logistics risk standpoint is to

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.960
 have the supply chains be at least located on the continent in which the car is built.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:13.080
 And so we are, I think the least company, the least affected car company with respect

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:19.560
 to tariffs, at least in my most respects, I mean, remains to be seen.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:26.760
 Now tariffs are still, you know, tough on a company when margins are still low.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.480
 But we do have localized supply chains in North America, Europe and China.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:52.720
 So that's, that puts us in a stronger position than any of our competitors.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.200
 And I'm doubly, I'm going to get a lot of questions about tariffs.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.080
 And I, I just want to emphasize that the tariff decision is entirely up to the president

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.520
 of the United States.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:09.360
 I will weigh in with my advice with the president, which he, he will listen to my advice, but

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.560
 then it's up to him, of course, to make his decision.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.640
 I've been on the record many times saying that I believe lower tariffs are generally

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.880
 a good idea for prosperity, but this decision is finally up to the elected representative

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.480
 of the people being the president of the United States.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:35.440
 So, you know, I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.640
 but that's all I can do.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:44.400
 So now, now let me walk you through why I'm so excited about the future of Tesla.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.560
 So first of all, autonomy, the team and I are laser focused on bringing rubber taxi

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.560
 to Austin in June.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:11:03.120
 And that's autonomy will first be solved for, for the model Y in, in Austin.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.200
 And then actually you should parse out the terms for robotic taxi or rubber taxi and

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:13.200
 just generally like, what's the, the cybercap because we've got a product called the cybercap

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.480
 and then any, any Tesla, which could be an S3, X or Y that is autonomous is a robotic

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.680
 taxi or a robot taxi is very confusing.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.960
 So the vast majority of the Tesla fleet that we've made is capable of being a robot taxi,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.320
 robotic taxi.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:45.080
 And as we're going from once we can make the whole system work where you can have paid

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:52.880
 rides fully autonomously with no one in the car in one city, that, that is a very scalable

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:59.840
 thing for us to go broadly within what, what, whatever jurisdiction allows us to, to operate.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:07.160
 So because what we're solving for is a general solution to autonomy, not a city specific

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.920
 solution for autonomy, once we make it work in a few cities, we can basically make it

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.040
 work in all cities in that, in, in that legal jurisdiction.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:22.240
 So if it's once we can make it based work in a few cities in America, we can make work

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.640
 anywhere in America.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.520
 Once we can make work in a few cities in China, we can make work anywhere in China, likewise

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:37.160
 in Europe, limited only by regulatory approvals.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:44.880
 So this is the advantage of having a generalized solution using artificial intelligence.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:54.880
 And the AI chip that Tesla designs specifically for this purpose, as opposed to very expensive

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.200
 sensors and high precision maps of a particular neighborhood where that neighborhood may change

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.120
 or often changes and then the cost stops working.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:13.200
 So a general solution instead of a specific solution.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:23.040
 And we got to Optimus, making good progress in Optimus.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:31.160
 We expect to have thousands of Optimus robots working in Tesla factories by the end of this

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.440
 year, I think this will work.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:47.920
 And we expect to scale Optimus faster than any product I think in history to get to millions

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.840
 of units per year as soon as possible.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:59.000
 I think feel confident in getting to a million units per year in less than five years, maybe

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.800
 four years.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:12.240
 So, 20, 30, I feel confident in predicting a million Optimus units per year.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.280
 It might be 20, 29.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:21.360
 So let's see what's restricted energy, the energy business is doing very well.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:32.080
 The mega pack enables the companies to output far more total energy than would otherwise

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.240
 be the case.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:42.920
 When you think of the energy capability of a bread, it's much more than a total energy

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:53.440
 output per year, if the power plants could operate at peak power for all 24 hours as

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.200
 opposed to being at half power or sometimes a quarter power at night, then you could double

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.520
 the energy output of existing power plants.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:09.560
 But in order to do that, you need to buffer the engines so that you can charge up something

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.420
 like battery pack at night and the discharge into the grid during the day.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:27.600
 So this is a massive unlock on total energy output of any given grid of course per year.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:34.320
 And utility companies are beginning to realize this and are buying in our mega packs at scale.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:41.640
 So at this point, a gigawatt class battery is quite a common thing.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:49.480
 So with many orders in the offer, we'll gigawatt and beyond batteries.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:54.540
 And we expect the energy, the station or energy storage business to scale ultimately to tarot

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.000
 watts per year.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.840
 So very, very good numbers.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:12.120
 Now, Q1, first quarters of a year are usually pretty tricky because it's usually the worst

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.640
 quarter of the year because people don't want to go buy a car in the middle of winter during

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.600
 a visit.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:31.400
 So we picked Q1 as a good quarter to do a cutover to the new version of the Model Y.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.160
 And we changed production of the world's best-selling cars, remembering that Model Y is the best-selling

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:46.760
 car of any kind on Earth with a 1.1 billion unit per year output of a single model.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.240
 And we did this change over at the same time in factories all across the world.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:55.920
 So congratulations to the Tesla team on an amazing job in calling off what is a very

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.680
 difficult transition.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:08.200
 So yeah, it's really-- that was very impressive work.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:17.440
 So yeah, in conclusion, while there are many near-term headwinds for us and the border industry,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.320
 the future for Tesla is brighter than ever.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:29.040
 The buy of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI powered robots.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:37.440
 So I like this phrase, sustainable abundance for all.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:43.200
 If you say, what's the ideal future that you can imagine, that's what you'd want.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:50.320
 You'd want abundance for all in a way that's sustainable, that's good for the environment.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.400
 Basically, this is the happy future.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.960
 If you say, what's the happiest future you can imagine?

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.400
 Which is that would be a future where there's sustainable abundance for all.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:09.120
 What's the best thing to have and we can get on Earth, basically?

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:16.920
 So thank you again to the Tesla team for all their efforts at the challenging time.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.320
 I look forward to continuing to lead the team to great success in the future.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320
 Great.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.320
 Thank you very much, Elon.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.640
 Before we move on, Bebov has some opening remarks as well.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.640
 Thanks, Elon.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:37.400
 As Elon mentioned, in Q1, we achieve something which has never been undertaken in the automotive

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.600
 industry of updating all our factories for the best selling car in the world, all at

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.240
 the same time.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.600
 And this is-- people don't understand, this will not a small feat.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:55.000
 They're not aware of anybody else being able to do the best selling car all at once within

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.640
 a quarter, and that too hitting all the timelines which we had established at the beginning.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.280
 So we'll bring kudos to the team for making this happen.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.720
 Additionally, we also hit record gross profit for energy storage business in the quarter.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.760
 Now getting back into the business, there's been a lot of speculation as to the reasons

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.000
 for the decline of our vehicle deliveries in the first quarter.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.440
 We had previously guided that we will be updating all factories, and this will lead to several

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:31.680
 weeks of lost production, which did happen as per-- the ripple effect of the change is

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:38.040
 not having enough new model Y available in most markets for people to see and experience

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.760
 till the last few weeks of the quarter.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:47.560
 Additionally, the negative impact of vandalism and unwarranted hostility towards our brand

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.640
 and our people had an impact in certain markets.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.680
 Despite this, we were able to sell out legacy model Y in US, China, and a few other markets

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.080
 within the world.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:05.480
 And again, just so people understand, we were producing the legacy model Y till middle to

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.940
 end of February.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.080
 And we switched over and we were able to still sell out within that period.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.400
 So again, big achievement by all the people that started making it happen.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:25.400
 We've been extremely-- we have a very extremely competitive vehicle lineup, which with most

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.240
 vehicles going through a recent update.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.160
 And after that, if it wants an FSD, you have a personal chauffeur, which can take you almost

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.680
 anywhere under supervision.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:42.000
 There are numerous stories shared by customers ranging from how it has entailed their daily

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.280
 commute to providing mobility to customers with disabilities to giving older customers

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.040
 the ability to travel comfortably and independently.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:57.320
 Not only is an FSD supervised safer than a human driver, but it is also improving the

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.400
 lives of individuals who experience it.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.160
 And again, this is something you have to experience.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.120
 And anybody who has experience just knows it.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:14.840
 And we've been doing a lot lately trying to get those stories out, at least on X, so

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.120
 that people can see how other people have benefited from this.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:25.800
 Now, coming into some of the financial stuff, auto margins decline sequentially primarily

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:32.800
 due to the reduction in the total number of deliveries, lower fixed cost absorption due

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:39.680
 to factory change-overs, and lower regulatory credit reviews, offset slight-- by a slight

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:45.760
 increase in pricing due to the launch of new model 1, despite incentives which we had to

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.840
 sell the legacy model 1.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:54.760
 Our energy storage business, like I said before, has achieved yet another milestone

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.800
 of great highest gross profit in the quarter.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.280
 This is despite sequential decline in deployments.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:10.280
 The importance of this business, as I mentioned, is pretty profound, especially in this environment.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:18.320
 Because in order for grids to work properly with the demands from AI and all this, you

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.320
 need some more stability.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:26.640
 And this is by far the simplest and best solution which we are aware of, which can help do this.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:32.720
 And we've also developed certain unique solutions to help our customers to achieve this.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:39.920
 Additionally, on the Powerwall side, we've been selling the new Powerwall 3.

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.480
 And it's been received with very good reception from customers and to the extent that we are

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.080
 currently supply constraint.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.440
 On services and other margins, they were slightly down sequentially, primarily because of the

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.640
 pressure on our use card business and insurance business.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.640
 Note that we continued our journey to improve profitability in our services and condition

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.160
 business through better labor productivity.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.360
 As previously discussed, our operating expenses continued to increase sequentially, primarily

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.960
 due to our AI-related initiatives, including Optimus, and also cost of development for

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.400
 vehicle programs, including cybercaps, SEMA, and cheaper models.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.320
 These expenses flow through R&D.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.480
 We believe even in the current environment, it is the right strategy in making investments

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.520
 in these areas to position us for the long term.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.520
 These increases were offset by decreases in the CNA from changes in our vehicle effort

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520
 program.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:48.160
 Other income reduced significantly on a sequential basis.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:56.280
 The primary reason was Bitcoin Mark-to-Market loss in Q1 versus Gain in Q4 resulting in

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.640
 a 472-minute drop.

00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.160
 The remainder of the change is because of FX remanagement.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:08.040
 With the adoption of the new Mark-to-Market standard for Bitcoin, we expect increased

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.700
 volatility in other income in addition to the FX reportability.

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.780
 I know we've kind of seen the hottest topic which people talk about, and it has various

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.880
 impacts to our business.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:28.100
 As Elon mentioned, on the vehicle business, we've been on this journey of regionalization

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:36.160
 for years, specifically in the U.S. model Y has been rated the most American-made car

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.620
 on Cars.com, made in America, indexed three years ago.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:45.660
 The second part is of all the work which the team has been doing over the years, and to

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:54.460
 the extent that today, if you look at our vehicle lineup in the U.S., we're approximately

00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:00.280
 on a weighted average basis, 85% USMCA compliant.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:06.060
 Like Elon said, this definitely gives us a bigger edge as compared to other OEMs in terms

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:13.820
 of managing the tariffs, but we're not immune because when the section 232 auto tariffs become

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.940
 effective in May, which includes Canada and Mexico, and Canada and Mexico has been part

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:25.180
 of our regionalization strategy, they will have an impact on profitability.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:31.060
 I know research modeling on this impact has been about a couple of thousand, which is

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:35.820
 pretty much in line with what we've been forecasting.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:42.100
 The impact of tariffs on the energy business will be outsized since we source LFP battery

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.100
 cells from China.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:48.340
 We're in the process of commissioning equipment for the local manufacturing of LFP battery

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:54.540
 cells in the U.S., however, the equipment, which we have, can only service a fraction

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:58.860
 of our total install capacity at later on.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:04.500
 We've also been working on securing additional supply chain from non-China-based suppliers,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:07.220
 but it will take time.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:15.420
 Also note that mega-fact is affecting all the impact on U.S. from tariffs on the energy

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:16.860
 business.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:24.560
 We do have mega-factory China, which just started operations at Q1, and that should take care

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.620
 of our business outside of U.S.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.680
 There's also an important impact of tariffs on our capital investments.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:38.680
 I know this is going to sound counterintuitive, since in order to on-shore manufacturing or

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.180
 expand lines, we have to bring equipment from outside the U.S. because there is not that

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:45.100
 much capacity in U.S.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:50.620
 The current trade environment, such equipment being brought in is subjective.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.360
 The expense is bringing in from China right now.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360
 Exactly.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:03.000
 And the reality is that China has the basic one, which has the most capacity to provide

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.860
 these equipment.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:11.060
 Our CAPEX guidance, inclusive of modern tariffs, even with the optimization we've tried to

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:17.200
 do, it is forecasted to be still in excess of $10 billion this year, and we're still

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:20.560
 evaluating what more to do on this.

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.140
 To summarize, we have near-term challenges in our business due to tariffs and band image.

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.460
 The thing, our strategy of providing the best product at a competitive price is going to

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.000
 be a winner, and this is the reason Western focused on bringing cheaper models to market

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000
 soon.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.700
 The start of production is still planned for June.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:46.000
 Additionally, the advancement in FSD-related features, including pilot robot taxi launch

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.260
 in Austin later this year, should help create a new era of devout.

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:55.000
 I would like to thank everyone at Tesla and our customers.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 Fantastic.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.880
 Thank you very much, Ebov.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.860
 Now we will move on to investor questions.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.320
 We will start with questions from say.com.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:09.680
 First question is, what are the highest risk items on the critical path to robot taxi launch

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.320
 and scaling?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000
 Is that a shock?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
 Yeah, we've got a shock online.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
 Sure.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.200
 Well, just to make, we're just talked by the, just to disambiguate, the CyroKat from robot

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.400
 taxi was gay.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:44.480
 So the, when will the Teslas, because the Teslas that will be fully autonomous in June

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.920
 in Austin are probably model-wise.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:59.640
 So that is, that's currently on track to be able to do paid rides fully autonomously

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.640
 in Austin in June.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:14.600
 And then to be in any other cities in the U.S. by the end of this year.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:20.240
 It's very difficult to predict the exact ramp, sort of week by week, month by month, except

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.440
 that it will ramp up very quickly.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.680
 So it's going to be like some, basically an S-curve where it's very difficult to predict

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.360
 the intermediate slope of the S-curve, but you kind of know where the S-curve is going

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:38.240
 to end up, which is the vast majority of the Tesla fleet being autonomous.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:46.000
 So that, that's why I feel confident in predicting large-scale autonomy around the middle of

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
 next year.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
 Right?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
 Yeah.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.600
 Certainly the second half of next year, meaning I break that there will be millions of Teslas

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:03.600
 operating autonomously, fully autonomously in the second half of next year.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.880
 Yeah.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:20.920
 It does seem increasingly likely that there will be a localized parameter set, sort of

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:39.240
 like, especially for places that have, say, very snowy weather, like, say, if you're in

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.560
 the Northeast or something, like this, you can think of it, it's kind of like a human.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.240
 Like, you know, if you, you could be a very good driver in California, but are you going

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:55.520
 to be also a good driver in a blizzard in Manhattan, you're not going to be as good.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.640
 So there is actually some value in, you can sort of drive, but you're probably, if an

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.040
 accident is higher.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:11.480
 So it's increasingly obvious that there's some value to having a localized set of parameters

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:24.580
 for different, you know, different regions and localities, but this is, I'll put that

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:30.960
 at the nice tab category, it's not the required category, again, it's very, really the car

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.000
 is just very much like a human.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:40.640
 It's digital neural nets and cameras, and humans operate with biological neural nets

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.520
 and eyes.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:48.000
 And so the same strengths and weaknesses will be present.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.480
 Or, you know, the digital neural net and cameras versus a biological neural net and

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480
 eyes.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.280
 Ashok, would you like to elaborate on that?

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.080
 Yeah, speaking to the location specific models, we still have a generalized approach and you

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:09.280
 can see that from, you know, deployment of FSD supervised in China, with this very minimal

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.240
 data that's like China specific, the models generalize quite well to completely different

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240
 driving styles.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:20.360
 That just like shows that the AI based solution that we have is the right one, because, you

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:25.680
 know, if you have gone down the previous rule based solutions or like more hard coded

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:30.600
 HD map based solutions, it will have taken like many, many years to get China to work.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.560
 You can see those in the videos that people post online themselves.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:42.160
 So the generalized solution that we are pursuing is the right one that's going to scale well.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.320
 And you can think of this location specific parameters that you don't need to ask a mixture

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:47.320
 of experts.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:53.520
 And if you're sort of like familiar with the AI models in GROC and others, they all use

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.480
 these mixture of experts to sort of specialize the parameters to specific tasks while still

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:07.880
 being general. This makes the model use limited amount of compute to solve for the diversity

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.440
 of tasks that it has to solve.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.520
 In terms of addressing the question that asks for, you know, what are the critical things

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.800
 that mean to get right?

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.600
 One thing I would like to note is validation, self driving is a long tail problem where

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.000
 there can be a lot of edge cases that only happen very, very rarely.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.120
 Currently, we are driving around in Austin using our QA fleet, but then it's super

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:32.760
 rare to get interventions that are critical for robot taxi operation.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.600
 And so you can go many days without getting a single intervention.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.400
 So you can't easily know whether you are improving or regressing in your capacity.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:47.480
 And we need to build out sophisticated simulations, including neural network-based video generation.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.480
 That's all happening in the background to make sure that we deliver a safe product and

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:58.000
 we are able to measure our safety, even though we can't just succeed by driving around the

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.500
 block or something like that.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.500
 Yeah.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:07.800
 I mean, very basic terms, if we're seeing an accident every 10,000 miles, well, then

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:12.660
 you have to drive 10,000 miles on average before you get an accident or an intervention.

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:14.720
 So it's like, okay.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:22.800
 Now imagine, I mean, we must be really, we must be very worked up by the sheer number

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800
 of Tesla's doing.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:29.720
 So if it's in Austin right now, we're like, well, it's going to look pretty bizarre.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.720
 Yeah.

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.720
 Some people are chasing us over here.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:35.720
 Yeah.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:42.720
 There's just always a convoy of Tesla's going, well, just going all over to Austin in circles.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.480
 But yeah, I just can't emphasize this enough.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.160
 In order to figure out the long-tail things, if it's one in 10,000, that says one in 20,000

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:59.560
 miles or one in 30, the average person drives 10,000 miles in a year.

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.520
 So now try to compress that test cycle into a matter of a few months.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:12.280
 That means you need a lot of cars during a lot of driving in order to compress that

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:18.280
 cycle, or to do in a matter of a month, what would normally take someone a year.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.280
 Yeah.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.080
 And I would just also add that, you know, if you haven't looked at those videos coming

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.280
 out of China, people are really-- Oh, yeah, those videos are amazing.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.280
 Yeah.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.280
 They're putting it to real test.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.280
 I mean, they're taking it to dark roads.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.840
 Frankly, I think the Chinese consumer might be the most American consumer.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:43.440
 Actually, customers in China are awesome.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.560
 They have a lot of fun with the cars.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:55.440
 I saw one guy take a Tesla on a narrow dirt road across like a mountain, and I'm like

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.440
 sort of a very brave person.

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:03.800
 And the Tesla's driving along on the road with no barriers where it makes a mistake.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.680
 He's going to plunge to his doom, but it worked.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.800
 Great.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800
 Thank you.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:16.320
 And if the question was on cybercap itself, we're in B-sample validation now.

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.320
 That's that question too.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:19.320
 Yeah.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:27.560
 We have our first-- Like big builds coming at the end of this quarter within Q2, and

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.080
 then, you know, in the coming months, we'll start to bar scale, you know, installation

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.560
 of all the equipment in giga-texas with, you know, still in schedule for production

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.560
 next year.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:37.560
 Yeah.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:41.080
 And I just want to also clarify, because I think people don't understand the thing that

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:45.360
 there's no new building being built, and where is cybercap going to go?

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.800
 Oh, it's in the-- It's in the same factory.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800
 Yeah.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800
 Yeah.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.160
 It's happy if people don't know it's just happy upstairs and all the long lines while

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.440
 we're still building the model-wise and cyber trucks every day.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440
 Yeah.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:04.640
 And it's worth noting that the Tesla Gigafactory in Austin is three times the size of the

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.640
 Pentagon.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640
 Including the garden.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 Yeah.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.640
 Including the ground zero garden.

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:15.780
 So, you know, goes with the Pentagon, like, it's probably used to look big, but then

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.280
 it won't.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280
 Great.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.440
 Thank you very much.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:24.960
 The next question is, "When will FSD on Supervise be available for personal use on

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:32.840
 and personally owned cars?"

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:39.400
 Before the end of this year, not necessarily, I'd say, within the U.S., like, we do want

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:46.320
 to test-- At Tesla, we're absolutely hardcore about safety.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.960
 We go to great lengths to make the safest car in the world and have the lowest accidents

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.720
 per mile and so-- and look, first, live, last.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.840
 So we want to be very careful.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.800
 So everyone will want to make it to be definitively safer than manual driving.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.160
 So it's not enough that it just be as safe.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.680
 It needs to be meaningfully safer than if it's for cars manually driven.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:19.920
 So and we want to confirm that there's not something-- We just want to be cautious.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920
 We'll throw a lot.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:25.520
 We don't want to jump in at the deep end with an army.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:38.320
 So with that said, I think we should be able to have it work in several cities later this

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:42.480
 year for personal use.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.880
 So the asset test being you should be able to-- Can you go to sleep in your car and wait

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.080
 for your destination.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:58.520
 And I'm confident that will be available in many cities in the U.S. by the end of this

00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.520
 year.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520
 Great.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.020
 Thank you very much.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:06.040
 The next question is, "Is Tesla still on track for releasing more affordable models

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.040
 this year?

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.240
 Or will you be focusing on simplified versions to enhance affordability similar to the rear-wheel-drive

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.240
 standard truck?"

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240
 Yeah.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.120
 We're still planning to release models this year.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.840
 As with all launches, we're working through, like, the last-minute issues that pop up.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.640
 We're knocking them down one by one.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:28.040
 At this point, I would say that ramp maybe might be a little slower than me at home initially,

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.480
 but there's nothing, you know, just kind of given that turmoil that exists in the industry

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.980
 right now.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.240
 But there's nothing blocking us from starting production within the next-- within 10-level

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.760
 laid out and opening remarks.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.800
 And I will say it's important to emphasize that as we've said all along, the full utilization

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.280
 of our factories is the primary goal for these new products.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.760
 And so flexibility of what we can do within the form factor and, you know, the design

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:55.760
 of it is really limited to what we can do on our existing lines rather than building

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:56.760
 new ones.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.960
 But we've been targeting the low cost of ownership monthly payment as the biggest differentiator

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.960
 for our vehicles.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.640
 And that's why we're focusing on bringing these new models with a big, no-loss price

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.840
 to the market within the constraints that you're selling.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:09.840
 Great.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.560
 Thank you very much.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.320
 And the next question is, "Does Tesla see Roblo taxi as a winner-take-most market?

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:21.760
 And as you approach the Austin launch, how do you expect to compare against Waymo's offering,

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.680
 especially regarding pricing, geofencing, and regulatory flexibility?"

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.680
 What?

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.680
 Okay.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.760
 The issue with Waymo's cars is it costs Waymo money.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:45.440
 But that is the issue.

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:48.480
 You know, the cars are very expensive, made in low volume.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:59.480
 Teslas are, you know, probably costing a quarter or 20 percent of what a Waymo costs and made

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.280
 in very high volume.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:11.440
 So, you know, ironically, like, we're the ones that made the bet that a Pure AI solution

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:16.640
 with cameras and the car actually will listen for sirens and that kind of thing, is the

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640
 right move.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:24.960
 And Waymo decided that expensive sensor suite was the way to go, even though Google's very

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.960
 good at AI.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:26.960
 So I'm wondering.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:35.280
 And it is worth noting that Tesla is both an incredible AI software team and AI hardware

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:42.560
 chip design team, from scratch, from nothing, for an acquired one, or just both of them.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:51.160
 So, yeah, it's really, I mean, I don't see anyone being able to compete with Tesla at

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160
 present.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:42:04.520
 And I'm sure that will change eventually, but at least as far as I'm aware, Tesla will

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:12.240
 have, I don't know, 99 percent market share or something ridiculous, about 90-something

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240
 percent.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:20.760
 At least, I don't know, at least some of them might change, but, you know, if we have millions

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:30.120
 of cars deployed next year, unless others have millions of cars deployed, unless we're blocked

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.960
 by regulatory situations, it won't be long.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:41.720
 I mean, in a few years, we'll have 10 million autonomous cars on the roads then, you know,

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:42.720
 and county.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:48.360
 I mean, the other thing which people forget is that we're not just developing the software

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.360
 solution.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.360
 We are also manufacturing the cars.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.800
 And like, you know what, like Vamo hands, they're taking cars, then trying to put them

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:57.800
 on.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:58.800
 Vamo wanted.

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.320
 We don't do that.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.640
 So that definitely gives us a big dig up.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:10.320
 And like Elon said, we only have a big existing fleet, which hopefully the software update

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.840
 could become autonomous.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.680
 With the software update, it will become autonomous.

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:23.480
 To be clear, the Model Y in being autonomous in Austin and June, are the Model Ys we make

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.480
 currently?

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.480
 There's no change to it.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:30.760
 I think people don't appreciate that the car which they can buy today, or the car they

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.400
 have, is capable of these kind of things.

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:40.120
 And it does drive autonomously from the factory to the end of flying every car.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.120
 Yeah.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.920
 Exactly, through the tunnel, the Model Ys, everything.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.920
 Right.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.920
 Exactly.

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.820
 We have, it is important to use, it's doing useful work fully autonomously at the factories

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.400
 as Ashok was mentioning.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:01.860
 The cars drive themselves from end of line to where this was picked up by a truck to

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:03.560
 be taken to a customer.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:10.400
 And I'm confident also that later this year, the first Model Y will drive itself all the

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.180
 way to the customer.

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:23.040
 So from our factory in Austin, and I went in here in Fremont, California, I've confident

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.760
 that from both factories, we'll be able to drive directly to a customer from the factory.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760
 To a plifthry.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760
 Yeah.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.960
 Literally goes from the end of line and drives themselves to your house.

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.520
 It's important to note in the factories, we don't have dedicated lanes or anything.

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:44.160
 They're coming out every day, trucks, delivery supplies, parts, construction, you know.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.880
 Well, if people can film it, by the way, you can see this from the road, like it's uncovered.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880
 Exactly.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.880
 In this video, people take videos online, and anyone who wants to go see it can just

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:59.080
 drive past our Fremont factory and see the autonomous cars, driving themselves and they

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:02.040
 drive themselves and they put themselves in the exact right spot to be picked up.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.280
 Yeah, the logistics yard is right there in the open.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280
 Yeah.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.520
 We don't move it again to another lane.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.440
 But they go to a specific spot.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.440
 Yeah.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.440
 Yeah.

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.480
 So, that's just a routine, like everyday thing.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.480
 Great.

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.960
 Thank you very much.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:25.000
 The next question is, can you please provide an update on the unboxed method and how that

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
 is progressing?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.000
 Sure.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 It's progressing.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 Absolutely.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.520
 As I mentioned just a minute ago, it is the basis for our cybercab manufacturing process.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.320
 Really what we've changed in order to allow the low cost of production and also get the

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:43.520
 super high levels of automation, really, levels of automation are sort of unheard of in the

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.520
 vehicle manufacturing scale.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:49.080
 This is not something that, you know, when you see it be produced, you'll think of in

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.480
 terms of like, wow, it's how the car has been built for a hundred years, it's really something

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:53.480
 we've changed.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.320
 In the past year, we've been like focusing on a lot of key development areas, like marrying

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:01.960
 these large sub-assemblies together in a precise way, in an accurate way.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.320
 We've also de-risked things like corrosion of uncoded aluminum structures, the sealing

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.160
 across the seams of the vehicle, and when you marry the assemble components, and we've

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.760
 even done early crash testing and proven that it's going to be just as safe as every other

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.640
 car we've built.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.800
 So with all that combined, we kind of go into the builds that we have at the end of this

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:30.360
 quarter for the cybercab product, and that's the next real big test of full-scale integration

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:36.360
 with the unbox process, and it's kind of where we are, so you'll see them in testing on the

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.960
 test roads in a couple of months.

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:49.080
 Yeah, although the line won't be upset at this rate initially, this is a revolutionary

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080
 production system.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:54.200
 I'm not sure what the right word is, unboxing sounds like something like when you get your

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.200
 phone.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.200
 Can you open it up?

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.240
 Yeah, you have like a pleasant experience when you take your phone out of the box.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:07.200
 Which of course is nice, but this is much more revolutionary than that.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:15.160
 This is a profound reimagining of how to make cars in the first place.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:18.240
 No car is made like this anywhere in the world.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.520
 The factory is the product as much as the car is the product.

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:31.480
 So this really is the first principles approach to manufacturing that will ultimately allow

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:41.600
 us, I'm trying to think, I'm confident ultimately and allow us to achieve a cycle time unit every

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.960
 five seconds or less, or for single line.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.080
 And we want to incorporate some of these for testing into our existing production lines

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.080
 as well.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:58.340
 So this is something I've been thinking about for a long time, and I've sort of been thinking

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:06.120
 about this for a long time, and it's kind of, it's not a crazy thing, like a car every

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.080
 five seconds may sound like it's coming out like bullets, but actually it's coming out

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.080
 at walking speed.

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.640
 It's a meter a second.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:22.000
 So this is like, we're still far away from caring about the aerodynamic drag of the

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:31.360
 manufacturer in line, you know, because you're still at three miles an hour or so, you know,

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:36.000
 every five seconds sounds crazy, but it's three miles an hour, so we're talking about.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.680
 So yeah, you can run away from it, basically.

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:49.880
 But that's still, by far, the fastest line on earth, you know, it's like half hour, half

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:54.600
 hour at night, that's kind of, what's like addressing the line on earth is like about

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600
 the chain.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.720
 And that's also 33 seconds, and we're the fastest, right?

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.720
 I think so.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:07.480
 We think we think we're the fastest at 33 seconds, you know, sharing my factory, but

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:14.360
 this would be, you know, six times faster or seven times faster or less.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:23.040
 So yeah, I mean, it'll be slower than that, but the point is that, like, when you fully

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.160
 optimize the design in operation of the next generation factory that we're building right

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.160
 now.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:38.440
 The five second cycle time or less is, the design is capable of it, you know.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:44.880
 So if you, you know, when you go through like a radical new architecture, you go from like

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:50.760
 being like in A, I mean, I'd say like probably sharing that in particular is in A plus on

00:49:50.760 --> 00:50:01.600
 a moderately, you know, in advance, but still traditional car production system.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:11.120
 So they're really doing about as good as possible as possible to do in a conventional scenario.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:16.960
 So trying to get much below, you know, sort of below like 30 seconds, extremely difficult,

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:23.160
 and you start getting into sort of impossible where you just, you have to be faster than

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.120
 a human could possibly move.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:32.200
 So then the autonomous line, it really just needs to be robust, moving really fast.

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.800
 And that's where you get to some five seconds.

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:44.600
 But we'll sort of getting a C in, instead of an A getting a C in a new architecture,

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:50.400
 but then the potential is there of time to move that up to an A plus within an A plus

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.400
 architecture.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.400
 Great.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400
 Thank you very much.

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:58.080
 The next question is, how is Tesla positioning itself to flexibly adapt to global economic

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:01.080
 risks in the form of terrorist political biases, et cetera?

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:08.200
 As Elon said, you know, we've been surprising team for a while.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:13.800
 We continue to mitigate global economic risks like tariffs and political biases by regionalizing

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:18.320
 part supply near its factories in North America, Berlin and Shanghai.

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.080
 For example, in North America, our high volume vehicle programs have over 85% North America

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.040
 content and Shanghai vehicles have over 95% local content.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:32.760
 But then a similar levels of regionalization as North America, when you exclude the battery

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:36.920
 and we are working on regionalizing the battery as well.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:42.680
 This is a pre-pandemic strategy that we accelerated post-pandemic to supply diversification, to

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:48.560
 sourcing vertical integration, advanced analytics and local partnerships to ensure supplies

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.840
 in resilience and production stability.

00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:56.840
 Having said that, we are not 100% insulated and these tariffs are higher on our low volume

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:00.240
 platforms than the high volume ones.

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.240
 Yeah.

00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.640
 In fact, there's no more vertically integrated car company than Tesla.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:14.760
 I mean, we're the most integrated car company since Henry Ford back in the day when they

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.620
 were doing mining iron and stuff and growing rubber trees.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:28.000
 So we're not growing rubber trees and mining iron yet, but we have built a lithium refinery

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.720
 in South Texas and it's the biggest lithium refinery outside of China, I think.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720
 Is that right?

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.720
 Yeah.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.720
 I think so.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:44.360
 It's out there, potentially, would be the biggest lithium refinery I've seen.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.680
 And we've got strays to expand it if we need to build more.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:48.680
 Right.

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.800
 And then we've got the cathode refinery in Austin next to the gate factory.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:57.440
 We're going to figure out what to do about the anode.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:03.140
 This is an ongoing subject of discussion.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:10.640
 The best possible will also be figuring out how to have no anode, best part being no part.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:16.840
 That's the dream of the lithium batteries to have an anode.

00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:23.400
 But either way, we better have the anode, the cathode, and the lithium and the electrolytes

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:28.960
 and the separator to make a cell.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.640
 But there's no other car company that has bought the lithium refineries and cathode

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:39.760
 refineries were ridiculously vertically integrated.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:45.680
 And that's our best position to protect against supply chain disruptions.

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.680
 Yeah.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.680
 All right.

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.160
 Do you want to talk about progress in the front?

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.160
 Yeah.

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.000
 We, in our cells, we've multi-sourced every component.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.560
 We have every part coming from at least two different countries, margin, which is-- we

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.200
 started this-- the supply chain team and the engineering team worked together on this

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:08.120
 for the last couple of years to put that together.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.160
 It's not something we did in a couple of months, this is years of work.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:17.240
 We're in a good position to get advantage of that.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:23.080
 And the insourcing of lithium and cathode, they're the two most critical parts of the

00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.440
 battery that's right in that backyard, and we're totally insulated from--

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.480
 Well, they need to be in operation.

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.480
 They need to be in operation.

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.480
 That's the right way.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:41.160
 We also make our own cells, by the way, so cell production, if you look at this, you

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:46.760
 make the anode, the cathode, the lithium, the electrolyte separator, the can, and then

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:50.880
 you've got to put all that together in the cell factory.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.520
 And there are entire companies that all they do is produce cells, but they don't do the

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.520
 other stuff.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:02.640
 They don't refine the lithium or the cathode, or-- so our cell production is going quite

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:13.160
 well, and I think we're-- we're currently sort of the lowest cost per kilowatt hour.

00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:23.880
 We have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour, all things considered.

00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:30.680
 So the Tesla cell is the most competitive cell in any-- yeah, for a kilowatt hour, according

00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.960
 to a car, if it's a Tesla cell, it's lower cost than it's a supplier cell.

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960
 Yeah.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:43.000
 And the plan this year is to really build off that base, getting to lowest cost is-- it's

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
 the hardest challenge for so many people, you know.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.960
 It's relatively easy to build a flashy product that does one thing well, to build something

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.280
 at high volume and low cost is super difficult, and we're kind of using that as a base to

00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:02.040
 then build off and add performance in different areas for new products coming out.

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:04.040
 Yeah.

00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.040
 So--

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.540
 Can I come?

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.540
 Yeah.

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:13.340
 I mean, to Elon's point, there's a lot of advantages for regionalization, you know, the most important

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:17.400
 thing is we're not trying to work in capital for six to eight weeks on the ocean.

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:21.820
 If there's a design change, then everything that's in transit basically has to be scrapped.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.760
 Secondly, poor disruptions, as we started in COVID, can be very expensive because slight

00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:30.260
 disconnects can shut down production, so then your only option is costly air expedite.

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.440
 It also gives us resilience and supply chain if one region is down, we can bridge with others.

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.700
 It's more work to set up in the beginning, but it's critical to have when the need arises.

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.660
 Having said that, it's unrealistic to zero 100 percent regionalization across the board

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.180
 for specialized areas such as semiconductors.

00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:48.140
 In such cases, our team works very closely with our partners to ensure we have strategic

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:54.060
 banks in place, and a disruption doesn't impact production while we stand up the regional

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.020
 manufacturing for that particular commodity.

00:56:56.020 --> 00:57:00.340
 And I'll say like on the rest of the vehicle, like Elon was talking about with sales, we're

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:05.240
 also heavily for integrated import ingots, you know, in terms of the testings, we recycle

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:08.440
 those in melts and there's the same thing with plastics, but it doesn't mean we're not

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.440
 exposed.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:16.320
 You know, we do have some areas where we use various magnets, you know, that we've been

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.920
 working for years to find alternative sources and bring those up as well as we have our

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.920
 induction machines.

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:25.320
 And as we've mentioned in the past, we're working on our ferrant numbers for some time.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:29.840
 So like as Karn said, you know, with our heavy regionalization percentages, we're definitely

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:35.420
 like the lowest, you know, exposed to this, but we're not completely immune, as Bob mentioned

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.100
 is what we've worked.

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.100
 Great.

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:44.900
 This is similarly related and on the battery guide is test list of a battery supply constraint

00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.300
 as noted on the Q4 call.

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.740
 And does that change the tariffs?

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.980
 So this is Karn.

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.140
 We've been working very hard to expand battery cell production in the U.S., both with vendors

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:59.620
 and what Bonnie mentioned earlier with the 4680 program.

00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:03.440
 And we're also working on moving the upstream supply chain for battery cells in the United

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:04.520
 States for several years.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.520
 And that strategy is really starting to pay off now.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.960
 As it stands right now, we're not constrained on battery cell supply for vehicles.

00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:16.000
 The recent tariffs do pose some challenges to Tesla Energy, like our CFO mentioned earlier,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.440
 but it's something we've been anticipating and we should be able to resolve in a timely

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.440
 fashion.

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.640
 We actually have a plan to find a place where we're executing towards it.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:29.480
 We also have some other sourcing sources coming online to supplement the shortfall

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:35.660
 and then, of course, we have the LFV production that's happening in-house.

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:40.340
 We have a slight disconnect of aligning the right cells with the right paths.

00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:44.020
 That's the little bit of puzzle that we have to solve internally.

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.260
 But as far as cells go, there's no shortage.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:48.260
 Great.

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:50.020
 Thank you very much.

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:54.860
 The next question is, did Tesla experience any meaningful changes in order inflow rate

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:58.660
 in Q1 relating to all the rumors of brand damage?

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:05.860
 So in Q1, as mentioned earlier, we took the best-selling car of the last two years and

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.680
 ramped up all four of our global factories, and in less than eight weeks, we've already

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:14.240
 gone to the rate of our previous model-wise, the factories.

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:17.600
 So just kudos again to the team for the great job there.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:24.560
 And despite the economic strain and negative articles in California and Q1, Tesla remained

00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.200
 the best-selling car, not just EV.

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:31.520
 And additionally, we had a record number of test drives globally in Q1 as well.

00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:34.600
 So interest remains high.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:40.920
 And so right now, we continue to see good interest still in the EGLE.

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:41.920
 Yeah.

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:50.200
 I mean, Tesla is more immune to the macro demand for cars.

00:59:50.200 --> 01:00:00.000
 So when there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on buying during a

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.960
 major capital purchase like a car.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:12.200
 But, you know, as far as absent from macro issues, we don't see any reduction in demand.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200
 Correct.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.320
 And that's where we continue to focus on the affordability.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.320
 Yeah, it's fun to focus there.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320
 Yeah.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.320
 Fantastic.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320
 Thank you, guys.

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:26.560
 The next question is, regarding the Tesla Optimist pilot line, could you confirm it if it is

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.560
 currently operational?

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:31.920
 If so, what is the current production rate of Optimist bots per week?

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.560
 Additionally, how might the recent tariffs impact the scalability of this production

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:37.560
 line moving forward?

01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:45.560
 No, Optimists, I wanted to start off with Optimist is still very much developed in the

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.560
 industry.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.560
 It's not a large volume production.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.560
 It's fine.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:56.840
 This year, you know, we'll make a few, you know, we do expect to make thousands of Optimist

01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.920
 robots, but most of that production is going to be at the end of the year.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.280
 So almost everything in Optimist is new.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:12.640
 There's not like an existing supply chain for the motors, gearboxes, electronics actuators,

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:19.960
 really anything in the, almost anything in Optimist, apart from the AI for Tesla, the

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.820
 Tesla AI computer, which is the same as the one in the car.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:34.160
 So when you have a new complex manufacturer product, it'll move as fast as the slowest

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:37.400
 and least lucky components in the entire thing.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:42.960
 And as a first order approximation, there's like 10,000 unique things.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:51.200
 So that's why that, that's why it isn't, anyone in here tells you they can predict with precision

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:59.320
 the production ramp of a truly new product is, doesn't know what they're talking about.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.560
 It is literally impossible.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.280
 So you go through this like series of constraints where it's like this part's a limited factor,

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:13.240
 now that part's a limited factor, and this part's a limited factor, and multiply that

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.080
 by a thousand basically.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.520
 And then the rate of the production ramp is decided by how quickly you can solve each

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.520
 of those problems.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:36.320
 Now, Optimist was affected by the magnet issue from China, because the Optimist actuators

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.360
 in the arm do use permanent magnets.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.680
 Now Tesla as a whole does not need to use permanent magnets.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:50.040
 But when something is volume constrained, like an arm of the robot, then you want to

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:53.080
 try to make the motors as small as possible.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.800
 And then, so we did the design in permanent magnets, permanent magnets for those motors,

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.840
 and those were affected by the supply chain, by basically China requiring an export license

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:10.520
 to send out any rare earth magnets.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.480
 So we're working through that with China, hopefully we'll get a license to use the rare

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:17.480
 earth magnets.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:21.280
 China wants some assurances that these are not useful military purposes, which obviously

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.280
 they are not.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.360
 They're just going into a humanoid robot.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:33.560
 So it's not a weapon system, but that is an example of a challenge there.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:40.560
 But I'm confident we'll overcome these issues, and we'll, by the end of this year, have thousands

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.560
 of profitless robots.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560
 Great.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.000
 Thank you very much.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.280
 And the last question we already covered earlier, whether RoboTaxi was selling truck

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280
 this year.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:54.840
 So with that, we can move on to analyst questions.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.360
 The first question is going to come from Pierre at New Street.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.880
 Pierre, please unmute yourself.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:06.480
 Hey guys, can you hear me?

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480
 Yeah.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480
 That's great.

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:14.880
 I'm super excited to hear RoboTaxi and Optimus becoming the very tangible future for Tesla.

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:21.640
 But I have actually a question on the legacy, not the legacy, but the current auto business.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:28.080
 And when I look back at the ramp of Model 3 a few years ago, I really saw it as being

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:34.680
 the iPhone of cars, a new product, completely reinvented, very different user experience,

01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:42.200
 vastly superior, impossible to match for traditional competitors.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:47.400
 And for the iPhone, it resulted in the high end of the smartphone market quadrupling in

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.760
 size and actually Apple taking 60% market share.

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.040
 And so when you look at the Model 3 and the Model Y today, I think they are still like

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:58.400
 really vastly superior to any other cars.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:07.200
 And I wonder why they've taken about 15% of their addressable market and not more, actually.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.520
 So another way to put it is why are there so many people still buying BMWs and Methodists

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:18.400
 knowing that the Model 3 and the Model Ys are out there and available.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:24.720
 And I wonder if you're trying to solve that really internally, if you understand why,

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.860
 you know, what are these auto buyers who are not buying a Model 3 or a Model Y missing

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:35.120
 and if you have ideas of things you could do to address that, maybe there is enormous

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.080
 value left on the table there.

01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:40.840
 Yeah, that's what I'm wondering these days.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:50.960
 Yeah, the reality is that in the future, most people are not going to buy cars.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:58.760
 So it's kind of what one could sort of say, look, I think one to continue with your phone

01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.760
 metaphor.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.320
 I mean, you can remember the days of the flip phones when there was, you know, 100 different

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:11.080
 flip phone designs, and I would, you know, the mistake that manufacturers made was to

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:17.880
 try to make many different variants of a flip phone, but which was a mistake.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:22.440
 They should have made the iPhone.

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.880
 So because obviously everyone's going to want a smartphone.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.280
 But in the beginning of the, when, you know, the iPhone came out, I was like, wow, I can't

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:39.640
 believe these guys are not reacting as though this is death, but they didn't, they kept

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.440
 making to variants and flip phones.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:49.240
 Nokia, I think at one point was the most valuable company in the world, close to it, but they

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:55.360
 kept making flip phones, you know, trying to find another model, maybe somebody wants

01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:01.080
 a phone of a different style, maybe this different color or whatever it is.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:10.960
 Nope, they just want a super intelligent phone that can do everything, just one.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:29.480
 So I said this many years ago, in the future, in the not too distant future, buying a gasoline

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:36.840
 car that is not autonomous will be like riding a horse while using a flip phone.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:40.960
 Some people still do it, but it's rare.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.520
 Okay, and thank you.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.440
 The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner at Wolf.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.960
 Emmanuel, please unmute yourself.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960
 Great.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.320
 Thanks for taking my question.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:04.480
 So Ilan, the public version of the FSD software still has a decent amount of, I guess, intermittent

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.800
 human interventions that are required.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.680
 So what's still required for the software on your end to get to a level where it doesn't

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:17.920
 need to be supervised, and I'm asking that in the context of obviously the June launch

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:22.800
 being in the next couple of months, what still needs to happen?

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:27.800
 And we are working on a number of items, too.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.800
 Go ahead.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.800
 Yeah.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.320
 I mean, we are aware of the interventions that are happening in the public bills, and

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.680
 that's why we are hardcore, burning it down, and really speaking, some initial launch city

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:44.280
 helps us focus on solving all the issues that you'd face here.

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.640
 For example, like we're focusing on Austin, we're not solving all the issues that customers

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:52.280
 in Boston or somewhere else might face.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:57.120
 And then here, we just have a big list of all the issues, just burn it down, and that's

01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.000
 what the team is working on, along with other sort of redundancy issues.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.760
 For example, if one of the computers goes down right down the customer fleet, it would

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:11.680
 throw the red hands and ask you to take over, but we don't want that kind of situation.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:15.400
 So you're solving both the reliability issues of the autonomy software and also the reliability

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:19.440
 issues of the system software together for Austin.

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:33.080
 Yeah, it really just works through a long tail of unusual interventions, so, and these

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:38.240
 are really very, like, this is a single item intervention every 10,000 miles.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.680
 I mean, there's a lot of driving you've got to do to even find one case with an update.

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.080
 Yeah, and some interventions that are happening due to systematic, like missing functionality,

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:53.720
 for example, for handling emergency vehicles correctly, you don't need to consume audio

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.800
 as an input, but then the customer facing versions don't have audio input, but the

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:03.920
 version that's in that's going to be in Austin will have audio input and so on.

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:09.240
 Okay, but would you have, like, remote operators, for example?

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:13.920
 I mean, every now and then if a car gets stuck or something, someone will, like, you know,

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:20.200
 unblock it, but it's bigger, we are a bit conservative and are 10 towards more safety

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:25.800
 than even if we get stuck every now and then, we do have remote support, but it's not going

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.680
 to be required for safe operation.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.440
 If anything, it's just required for more availability.

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.680
 Anyway, it's only a couple of months away, so you can save yourself in a couple of months

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.680
 in Austin.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680
 Great.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:45.160
 Our next question comes from Edison at Deutsche Bank.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.200
 Edison, please unmute yourself.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.000
 Hi, thank you very much for the question.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.040
 So I wanted to ask about the the optimist supply chain going forward.

01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.400
 You know, you mentioned, you know, very fast ramp up.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.560
 What do you envision that supply chain looking like?

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:11.700
 Is it going to require many more suppliers to be in the U.S. now because of the tariffs?

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:16.040
 How does one kind of think about what needs to happen there?

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:22.560
 I have to see how things settle out.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.960
 I don't know yet.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:25.960
 Great.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.720
 I mean, so some things we're doing, as we've already talked about, which is that we're

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.360
 really taking tremendous steps to localize our supply chain, we're more localized than

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:44.360
 any other manufacturer, and I may have a lot of things underway that to increase the localization

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:51.000
 to reduce supply chain risk associated with geopolitical uncertainty.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
 Did you have a follow-up, Edison?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.000
 Yeah.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.640
 I wanted to come back, actually, to the the RoboTaxi then.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:02.560
 Do you have a sense on how many cars or how big the scale will be initially and how that

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560
 might ramp up?

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:07.960
 I know you're targeting, you know, millions of vehicles in the second half, kind of of

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960
 next year.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:13.640
 But initially, at launch, how many vehicles would be reasonable and is it going to be

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:19.120
 as simple as if one goes to Austin, let's say, in late June or July, you'd be able to

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.120
 request?

01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.120
 Yeah.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:28.480
 We're still debating the exact number to start off on day one, but it's, I don't know, maybe

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:38.800
 10 or 20 vehicles on day one, and watch it carefully, they scale it up rapidly after that.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.080
 So, you know, we want to make sure that we're paying very close attention the first time

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.080
 this happens.

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:52.320
 But yeah, you're able to end up in June or July, just go to Austin and what are Tesla

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:55.200
 and what are those driving?

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.200
 Great.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.600
 And the next question comes from George at Kanakort.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.840
 Hi, thank you for taking my question.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.680
 It has to do with FSD pricing.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:13.640
 Can we envision when you launch unsupervised FSD that there could be sort of a multi-tiered

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:20.240
 pricing approach to unsupervised versus supervised similar to what you did with autopilot versus

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.600
 FSD in the past?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.100
 Thank you.

01:13:23.100 --> 01:13:29.880
 I mean, this is something which we've been thinking about, I mean, just so you know,

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:36.120
 for people who have been trying FSD and who've been using FSD, they think even the current

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:43.160
 pricing is too cheap because for 99 bucks, you're basically getting a personal show.

01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:44.160
 Yeah.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:50.760
 I mean, would you need to give people more time to, they want to look at, like a key

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.200
 break point is can you read your text messages or not?

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.200
 Yes.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:56.400
 Can you write a text message or not?

01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.800
 Because obviously people are doing this, by the way, with auto-autonomous drives all

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.800
 the time.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.680
 And if you just go for a drive down the highway and you'll see people texting while driving

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:07.520
 doing 80 miles an hour.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.920
 And putting makeup on in the same time.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920
 Yeah.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.640
 But putting on makeup, doing their hair with them, mirror down and texting and driving at

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640
 80 miles an hour.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.760
 This is a common occurrence.

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:34.160
 So if you're eating lunch, you name it, shaving, you know, so anyway, but right now the car

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:39.120
 is very insistent that you pay attention to the road.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:47.600
 So which produces a value somewhat because it's very rigorous about you paying attention

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600
 to the road.

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:55.280
 And we'll gradually lighten up on that with, you know, every few weeks or every month.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:04.140
 We'll relax that a little bit and make it so you can be more and more able to do things

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:10.120
 you want to do and not have the car to manage your average attention.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:17.800
 So that value, it'll really be profound when you can basically do whatever you want, include

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:25.560
 a sleep and then that $99 is going to seem like the best $99 you've ever spent in your

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560
 life.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:30.080
 And George, did you have a follow-up?

01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:32.680
 My follow-up is about geographic expansion.

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.220
 Just maybe discuss additional markets.

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:37.900
 You know, there's been some news around India recently that you could launch this year and

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:38.900
 next.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.900
 Thank you.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.540
 So, yeah, I mean, we've been working on getting into India.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:52.340
 India is a very hot bucket and especially the current, and I don't want to talk just

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.780
 about tariffs, but the current tariff structure within is that any car which we send in is

01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:04.040
 subject to 70% tariff, also like a 30% luxury tax on it.

01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:10.640
 So, you know, the same car which we were sending is like 100% more expensive than what it is.

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:17.120
 So that creates a lot of, you know, anxiety is like, you know, people feel okay, they're

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.880
 paying too much for the car.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.080
 And by the way, we're not getting the money, the local government is getting the money.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.760
 And that's why we've been very careful trying to figure out when is the right time.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.380
 And we, like I said, we are working on it, it's a great, it would be a great market to

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:39.180
 enter because India has a big middle class, which we would want to tap in and that is

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.380
 the market which we want to be in.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:46.140
 But again, these kind of things create a little bit of tension which we're trying to work

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.140
 around.

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:48.140
 Great.

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.660
 Thank you so much.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.860
 The next question comes from Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley.

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:07.460
 Go ahead, Adam.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.460
 We can't hear you, Adam.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:14.220
 So, maybe we'll put you back in the queue and we'll move to Colin Langen from Wells Fargo

01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:21.620
 while Adam figures out his audio.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.940
 Colin, please unmute yourself.

01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:23.940
 Oh, great.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:24.940
 Do you hear me?

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.940
 Yes.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:26.940
 Oh, great.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:30.520
 You know, you're still sticking with the vision-only approach.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:35.000
 A lot of autonomous people still have a lot of concerns about, you know, sun glare, fog

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.800
 and dust.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:42.200
 Any color on how you anticipate on getting around those issues because, in my understanding,

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.200
 it kind of blinds the camera when you get glare and stuff?

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:51.240
 Actually it does not blind the camera.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:56.500
 We use an approach which is direct photon count.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:07.460
 So when you see a processed image, so the image that goes from the sort of photon counter,

01:18:07.460 --> 01:18:13.040
 the silicon photon counter, that then goes through a digital signal processor or image

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.180
 signal processor, that's normally what happens.

01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:23.720
 And then the image that you see looks all washed out because if you point the camera

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:32.780
 at the sun, the post-processing of the photon counting washes things out.

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:35.700
 It actually adds noise.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:41.460
 So a big breakthrough that we made some time ago was to go with direct photon counting

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:46.760
 and bypass the image signal processor.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:52.460
 And then you can drive pretty much straight at the sun, and you can also see in what appears

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:55.180
 to be the blackest of nights.

01:18:55.180 --> 01:19:03.380
 And then here in fog, we can see as well as people can, probably better, but I'd say

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:13.220
 probably slightly better than people, but the average person anyway.

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:21.040
 So the camera is able to see when there's direct glare on it, I'm surprised by that.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040
 Okay.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.160
 And then just, there are obviously media reports the other day that the affordable model was

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.960
 delayed, doesn't sound like that's correct.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:35.360
 Those reports also talked about it being more of a cheaper version of the Model Y.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.160
 Any color on what we should expect?

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.160
 Is it a cheaper version of the Model Y or is it actually going to be a design change

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.780
 with it?

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:49.380
 So I think Lars only covered it in answering one of the say.com gaussians.

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:54.260
 The real thing which we are trying to focus on is affordability.

01:19:54.260 --> 01:20:00.140
 And using existing lines, and there's always limitations when you're using existing lines

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.260
 as to how many different form factors can you bring to.

01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:09.260
 So that's the way I would say you should think about it and I don't know Lars, anything more

01:20:09.260 --> 01:20:10.260
 to add?

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:15.480
 I think we have this stuff for another calls like with recent upgrades to the Model 3 and

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:20.020
 the Model Y platforms, we need some pretty great cars, pretty great prices, and we added

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.000
 a bunch of features and things like that.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.840
 I think it's easy to consider that moving forward, Tesla doesn't make bad cars and we

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:31.560
 always make, our intent is not to make a car that is any worse than any car we've ever

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560
 produced in the past.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.640
 And so the models that come out in the next months will be built on our lines and will

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.500
 resemble the form and shape the cars we currently make and the key is that they'll be affordable

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:44.720
 and they'll be able to buy one.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720
 Great.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:51.060
 We might have time for one last question, Adam will try your audio again.

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:57.140
 You want to try to unmute yourself, Adam?

01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:02.700
 All right, unfortunately it's still not working.

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:15.880
 All right, guys, technology, yeah, hi, in the February 28th, Joe Rogan interview, Elon,

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:21.240
 you advocated for a rampant tariffs to give people time to adjust, otherwise, you said

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.800
 the system would break and bad things would happen.

01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.920
 So are things breaking yet?

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:34.780
 And if the announced, if the tariffs as announced remain in place, when would things start breaking?

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:41.480
 Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, I'm not, I'm one of many advisors to the president,

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:50.920
 I'm not the president, so, and, but I, you know, I've made my opinion clear to the president

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:58.680
 and that, you know, and other people made their opinion clear to the president.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:05.200
 He listen, he talks to many people and he makes his decision and, you know, I'm hopeful

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.520
 that the president will observe whether my predictions are more accurate than the predictions

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:15.280
 of others and perhaps where my advice differently in the future we shall see.

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:24.720
 But, you know, I'm an advocate of, you know, predictable tariff structures and generally

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:33.280
 I'm an advocate for, you know, pre-trade and lower tariffs, but now one does need to take

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:44.480
 a look at where if some country is doing something predatory with tariffs or is providing that

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:50.520
 extreme support for, if a governor is providing extreme financial support for a particular

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:56.520
 industry, then you have to do something to counteract that, so, but I think that that's

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:05.840
 on a case-by-case basis strategically, but, you know, the president is the elected representative

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.720
 of the people and is fully within his rights to do what he would like to do.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.280
 Okay, Elon, I respect that.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:24.240
 Just as a follow-up and thanks again, between China and the United States, who in your opinion

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:32.680
 is further ahead on the development of physical AI, specifically on humanoids and also drones,

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:37.680
 I'd be interested in, and is it even close and kind of how, I, yeah, I think, serious.

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:49.880
 Well, I think, you know, the answer, I mean, you know, a friend of mine of all made this,

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:57.240
 you know, posted on X, I reposted it, but I think a prophetic statement, which is any

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.520
 country that cannot manufacture its own drones is doomed to be the vastest state of any country

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:13.840
 that can, and we can't, America cannot currently manufacture its own drones, but that's again.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:21.280
 Fortunately, so China, I believe, manufactures about 70% of all drones, and if you look at

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:27.200
 the total supply chain, China is almost 100, almost 100% of drones are, have a supply chain

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:36.640
 dependency on China. So China is in a very strong position. And here in America, we need

01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:47.120
 to shift more of our people and resources to manufacturing, because this is, you know,

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:53.400
 I have a lot of respect for China, because I think China is amazing, actually, but the

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:59.040
 United States does not have such a severe dependency on China for drones, and be unable

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:04.880
 to make them, unless China gives us the parts, which is currently the situation.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:17.360
 You know, with respect to humanoid robots, I don't think there's any company in any country

01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:34.040
 that can match Tesla. Tesla and SpaceX are number one. So, and then, now, I'm a little

01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:42.680
 concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks two through 10 will be Chinese companies, but

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:50.760
 I'm confident that rank one will be Tesla. Great. Well, I think that's unfortunately

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.560
 all the time we have for today. We appreciate all your questions and look forward to talking

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.440
 to you next quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.
